This project is my personal web page I made in my web development class; It was my first time ever using HTML5 and CSS to create a web page, let alone for myself. Obviously it's not the prettiest website in the world, but I learned a lot while creating it and put in work so that I could finish with a product I was happy with as a first timer using HTML/CSS. It has four pages with a menu bar linking to each page detailing different topics about myself, my resume, and even an index home page including some info about the project. Presenting our project was also apart of the assignment, and I really enjoyed demoing it to the class and presenting my work to an audience. I also got to see so many other cool projects and modeled my future assignments towards how my peers styled/designed their pages. This helped me overall get better as a coder as I got to see the ideas what other students created and then give and recieve feedback on work. Overall, though a simple webpage, this really kickstarted my liking for web design and web development, and it made me broaden my goals as a developer and student more.

HOW TO RUN.
1. Load all pages into a code editor.
2. Click the 'index.html' page and click run to launch the page into a browser.
3. Once on the home page, click any of the menu buttons to be brought to a new page.
4. The server is styled so that it changes its appearance based on window size, so feel free to mess with the page sizing to see how the content reacts!

Note: The pictures on the pages may not load due to how they're formatted in the html!
